                    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>Working at Ontario Veterinary College as a research assistant for the Global Burden of Animal Disease project has given me a lot of web development experience. In this position I was able to create new interfaces for users using HTML, CSS, and Python. I got to develop skills in using API's as well as Flask applications and Dashly. Furthermore, my collaborative skills also developed as I worked in a small team which required constant communication between each member to complete features. In this position I was able to incorporate my knowledge from university and deliver the best product that would follow UI/UX design rules.</p>

                    <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of 4 years in my programming career I have been able to innovate my skills and learn new expertise. My core programming courses have taught me data structures and how to build applications. An example of this is, my design courses have taught me how to design applications in regards to the users and how they would interact. I have also built an eStore using my programming knowledge which would allow users to store and search for products. Furthermore, I am also minoring in business and I have taken courses such as marketing and economics. Marketing has taught me how to advertise products and client relations. I hope to gain more knowledge through the rest of my university experience.</p>
